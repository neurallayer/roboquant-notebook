# This property file contains environment settings that will be made available in roboquant
# Many data feed providers and brokers require one or more keys to be able to access their APIs, and this is one of
# the ways to provide those credentials.
#
# If you store credentials in here, make sure other people don't have access to it and don't version control
# it to a public repo by mistake. One solution is to place this file at ~/.roboquant/.env
